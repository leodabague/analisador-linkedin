npm run build
```
Creates optimized production build in `dist/` directory.

### Lint Code
```bash
npm run lint
```
Runs ESLint with the project configuration.

### Preview Production Build
```bash

## Architecture Overview

This is a **LinkedIn Network Insights Analyzer** - a React-based single-page application for analyzing LinkedIn CSV exports.

### Core Architecture
- **Frontend-only SPA** with no backend dependencies
- **Client-side data processing** using browser APIs only
- **State management** via React's useState with derived computations using useMemo
- **CSV processing** handled by PapaParse library
- **File handling** supports both single file upload and folder selection (webkitdirectory)

### Key Data Flow
1. **Data Input**: CSV upload (single file or folder with subfolders)
2. **Data Deduplication**: Automatic removal of duplicate rows using canonical key comparison
3. **Data Analysis**: Real-time computation of insights (companies, roles, seniority, connections, locations)
4. **UI Presentation**: Tabbed interface with drill-down cards and paginated results
5. **Data Export**: CSV export capability for filtered/paginated results

### Major Components Structure
- `LinkedInInsightsAnalyzer` (main component in App.jsx) handles:
  - File upload and folder selection logic
  - State management for UI interactions (selected companies, pagination, etc.)
  - Drill-down functionality with smooth scrolling
  - CSV export utilities
- `src/utils/` directory contains modular utility functions:
  - `companyUtils.js` - Company processing, normalization, clustering, and extraction logic
  - `companyAliases.js` - Known company aliases and canonical name mapping

### Data Processing Logic
- **Company Extraction**: Centralized `extractCompanyFromTitle()` function using regex patterns
- **Company Clustering**: Intelligent similarity-based grouping with alias resolution
- **Role Categorization**: Pattern matching for functional areas (Technology, Sales, Marketing, etc.)
- **Seniority Detection**: Hierarchical pattern matching (C-Level â†’ Intern)
- **Connection Analysis**: Mutual connections and networking metrics
- **Geographic Analysis**: Location frequency distribution

### Tech Stack Details
- **React 19** with functional components and hooks
- **Vite** for development server and build tooling
- **Tailwind CSS v3** for styling (deliberately using v3, not v4 for stability)
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **PapaParse** for CSV parsing/unparsing

### Expected CSV Format
The application expects LinkedIn export CSVs with these columns:
- `linkedin_url` - Profile URL
- `name` - Person's name  
- `degree_connection` - Connection degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- `title` - Job title/position
- `location` - Geographic location
- `followers` - Follower count
- `mutual_connections` - Number of mutual connections

### UI Patterns
- **Tab-based navigation** with disabled states when no data loaded
- **Card-based drill-down** with smooth scrolling to expanded sections
- **Paginated results** (10 items per page) with Previous/Next navigation
- **Export buttons** for downloading filtered CSV results
- **Collapsible sections** with CSS transitions for smooth expand/collapse
- **Footer spacing** added to ensure pagination controls remain visible

## Code Organization

### Utility Functions
- **Company Processing**: All company-related logic centralized in `src/utils/companyUtils.js`
  - `extractCompanyFromTitle()` - Extract company names from job titles
  - `normalizeCompanyName()` - Normalize company names for comparison
  - `clusterCompanies()` - Group similar company names using intelligent algorithms
  - `calculateSimilarity()` - Calculate similarity between company names
- **Company Aliases**: Known company variations managed in `src/utils/companyAliases.js`
  - Predefined mappings for major companies (consulting, tech, financial, Brazilian companies)
  - `findCanonicalFromAliases()` - Resolve company aliases to canonical names

### Best Practices
- **DRY Principle**: Common logic extracted to reusable utility functions
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate utility files for different concerns
- **Consistent Processing**: All company extraction uses the same centralized logic
- **Performance Optimized**: Caching and efficient algorithms for large datasets
